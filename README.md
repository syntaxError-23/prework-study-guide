# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


In building this project, and ultimately completing this course, I aim to acquire the skills necessary to gain employment as a web developer.

The purpose of this project is to introduce the foundational concepts of web development and practice thinking like a developer. 

The problem is that as a student, I have been given a lot of information that I'd like to retain. The prework study guide webpage solves that by acting as a digital collection of notes that are precise and distinct. It is also evidence of my ability to use this information in and of itself.

I learned how to structure a webpage with HTML, style it with CSS, make it interactive with Javascript and use Github to save my work to the cloud. Having previously worked with HTML, CSS and Javascript, this project has been great refresher. Working with Git (especially in the terminal) is something I haven't done as extensively and it has a been very interesting learning curve. As I write this, I am learning how to deploy the project I've been working. Hopefully, by the time you read this, I will have achieved my aim.
