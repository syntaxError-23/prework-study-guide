# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


I've always been enthralled by technology. This project is the first I've created with a clear sense of direction - that is working in web development. In completing this project and this program as a whole, I aim to be ready for employment in an industry that can potentially provide an immensely rewarding career.

The purpose of this project is to introduce the foundational concepts of web development and practice thinking like a developer. 

The problem is that as a student of web development, I have been given a lot of information that I'd like to retain. The prework study guide webpage solves that by acting as a digital collection of notes that are precise and distinct. It is also evidence of my ability to use this information in and of itself.

I learned how to structure a webpage with HTML, style it with CSS, make it interactive with Javascript and use Github to save my work to the cloud. Having previously worked with HTML, CSS and Javascript, this project has been great refresher. Working with Git (especially in the terminal) is something I haven't done before so that has been very interesting. As I write this, I am learning how to deploy the project I've been working. Hopefully, by the time you read this, I will have achieved my aim.
